# Domineering games with minimal number of moves

The paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02796).

## What is domineering?
Domineering is a 2-player [(combinatorial) game](https://brilliant.org/wiki/combinatorial-games-definition/) played on a rectangular board (of any size).  Play consists of the two players alternately placing a <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%241%20%5Ctimes%202%24"> tile (domino) on adjacent empty squares; Left places vertically and Right places horizontally. The game ends when the player whose turn it is cannot place a piece; and the player who cannot place loses - this is the *normal play* condition.

## What did we do?
We find the minimum number of moves for a game of domineering to end on all rectangular boards up to size <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%248%20%5Ctimes%208%24">. For this, we used the Maple codes ⤴️ and the analysis described on Page 3 of our paper to find the answers.
